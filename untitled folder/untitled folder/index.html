    <p class="overview"> Hello, my name is Riley! I have been wanting to learn to code for many, many years and am excited to finally pull the trigger! In the far future I would like to develop my own game and have it be successful. In the meantime I am eager to learn about the world of coding and expanding my knowledge as much as possible!</p>
    <h2 id="#my-start">How I got my start</h2>
    <p> I have played video games my whole life so growing up I wanted to become a video game developer. In high shcool I started thinking about learning to code and becoming a software developer however, once I graduated I ended up getting a good job at a car dealership and put my plans on hold. I did end up taking a couple courses through codeacademy but never never got fully into it. Now that I am working from home and wanting to further my education, I am excited to take on this bootcamp!</p>
    <p> One of my previous co-workers in my current job finished this bootcamp and had nothing but good things to say about it. After speaking with her I knew that this would be a good fit for me because I do not want to go back to traditional school and have to go through 4 years when I can do this bootcamp and learn more on my own. With having night classes 3 days a week as well as all the resources provided by the Grand Circus team, I am ready for this journey!</p>
